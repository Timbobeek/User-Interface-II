        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Before joining Lambda, I tried various professions (interpreter, tutor, etc.), but none of it worked out. At some point, when job searching, I noticed QA positions and became interested. I applied for jobs, but was not able to get any offers with my little testing knowledge, so I have decided to get some proper education in the field and go above even by applying for the full stack class at Lambda. I want to work in the software development industry some day!
